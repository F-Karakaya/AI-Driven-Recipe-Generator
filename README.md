# 🍽️ AI-Driven Recipe Generator

> **AI-Driven Recipe Generator** is an intelligent recipe generation web application that leverages state-of-the-art AI models to create *ingredients lists*, *step-by-step cooking instructions*, *AI-generated food images*, and *fun fictional stories* based on a dish name you provide.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project shows how **AI can assist creativity in everyday tasks** like cooking. Instead of browsing countless recipes online, simply enter a dish name and get:

- 🧾 A detailed ingredients list  
- 👨‍🍳 Clear cooking steps  
- 🖼️ An AI-generated image of the dish  
- 📖 A playful fictional story related to the dish

This demonstrates generative AI in real-world applications — **Natural Language Generation**, **Multimodal outputs (text + image)**, and practical UI interaction.

---

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

While the original project files contain HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, common patterns in AI recipe generators include integration with APIs such as:

- **OpenAI API** for text and image generation (GPT, DALL-E)  
- **Fetch / AJAX** for client-side API calls  
- Parsers or PHP backend to proxy requests securely  
- Responsive UI in HTML/CSS

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Below is the typical workflow for AI-driven recipe generation:

1. 👤 **User enters a dish name** (e.g., “Spicy Beef Stew”).  
2. 📤 The app sends the prompt to an **AI language model**.  
3. 🔄 Model returns:
   - Ingredients
   - Cooking steps
   - Optional image and fictional description  
4. 📋 The UI presents this data neatly to the user.

## 📋 Features

✔️ Generate recipes simply by entering a dish name  
✔️ Get AI-generated ingredients & instructions  
✔️ AI image representation of predicted dish  
✔️ Fictional story for added creativity  
✔️ Easy to extend with modern APIs (e.g., OpenAI)  
✔️ Open-source and MIT licensed

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/F-Karakaya/AI-Driven-Recipe-Generator.git
cd AI-Driven-Recipe-Generator

### 2. Install Dependencies
If the project uses a backend (PHP/Node/Python), install appropriate dependencies.
For example, in a Node/Express setup:
npm install

If using PHP and hosting locally:
Use Apache or PHP built-in server:
php -S localhost:8000

### 3. Configure AI API Keys
To connect with an AI service (e.g., OpenAI), create a .env:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

### 4. Run the Application
Start the server or open index.html in your browser:
npm start   # if using Node
# or
php -S localhost:8000   # for PHP

## 📦 Deployment
Deploy on platforms supporting static + server logic:
- Vercel / Netlify for static + serverless API
- Heroku / Render for backend server
- Traditional LAMP/LEMP hosting for PHP
